# -------------------------------SERVLETS-------------------------------

## ------------------------------------**STATIC PAGE VS DYNAMIC PAGE**-------------------------

**STATIC PAGE**: Static Page is where Prebuilt content is same every time the page is loaded.

**DYNAMIC PAGE**: Dynamic page is where Content is generated quickly and changes regularly according to request.
				  The page contains "server-side" code which allows the server to generate the unique content when the page is loaded.

When a user browses internet, they request for web pages according to their needs. If it's a static web page, request is sent to the client and it respponds with the static HTML page.
But, when its a *Dynamic WebPage*, the webpage is not found to be on the server. The request then goes to a helper application, also called *Web Container* (TomCat).
The web Container consists of servlets.

**SERVLETS** : A servlet is basically a java file which takes request from the client, processes the information and then sends the response to the client in the form of an HTML file.

**DEPLOYMENT DESCRIPTOR:** The deployment descriptor is the file used by the servlet container to define which servlets match up with which request(URLs). A we.xml file in this case

**STRUCTURE OF WEB.XML FILE:**
```
<web-app>

  <servlet>
    <servlet-name>[SERVLET NAME]</servlet-name>
    <servlet-class>[SERVLET CLASS]</servlet-class>
  </servlet>

  <servlet-mapping>
    <servlet-name>[SERVLET NAME]</servlet-name>
    <url-pattern>[SERVLET URL]</url-pattern>
  </servlet-mapping>
</web-app>    
```


# -----------------------Creating first project------------------

### Create an HTML page to send request.

index.html

```
<html>
	<body>
		<form action="add">
		Enter first value <input type="text" name="num1">
		Enter second value <input type="text" name="num2">
		<input type="submit">
		</form>
	</body>
</html>
```
## Create a new class in a java file ie. servlet (AddServlet.java)

```
import jakarta.servlet.https.*;
public class AddServlet extends HttpServlet
{
	public void service(HttpServletRequest req, HttpServletResponse resp){
	int i= Integer.parseInt(req.getParameter("num1"));
	int j= Integer.parseInt(req.getParameter("num2"));
	int k= i+j;
	System.out.println("The result is "+k);  //print on conseole
	resp.getWriter().println("The result is "+k); //print on browser
	}
}
```

Just these two files are not enough. The HTML file is the clients request. The servlet file is the server processing. the haven't been yet connected. The Deployment descriptor comes into place now.
We create a Web.xml file which mentions all servlets and maps their respective URLs

```
<web-app>
  <servlet>
    <servlet-name>abc</servlet-name>
    <servlet-class>com.random.AddServlet</servlet-class>
  </servlet>
  <servlet-mapping>
    <servlet-name>abc</servlet-name>
    <url-pattern>/add</url-pattern>
  </servlet-mapping>
</web-app>
```
