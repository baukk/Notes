# ------------------------------------SERVLETS-------------------------------

## ------------------------------------**STATIC PAGE VS DYNAMIC PAGE**--------------------------------

**STATIC PAGE**: Static Page is where Prebuilt content is same every time the page is loaded.

**DYNAMIC PAGE**: Dynamic page is where Content is generated quickly and changes regularly according to request.
				  The page contains "server-side" code which allows the server to generate the unique content when the page is loaded.

When a user browses internet, they request for web pages according to their needs. If it's a static web page, request is sent to the client and it respponds with the static HTML page.
But, when its a *Dynamic WebPage*, the webpage is not found to be on the server. The request then goes to a helper application, also called *Web Container* (TomCat).
The web Container consists of servlets.

**SERVLETS** : A servlet is basically a java file which takes request from the client, processes the information and then sends the response to the client in the form of an HTML file.

**DEPLOYMENT DESCRIPTOR:** The deployment descriptor is the file used by the servlet container to define which servlets match up with which request(URLs). A we.xml file in this case

**STRUCTURE OF WEB.XML FILE:**
```
<web-app>

  <servlet>
    <servlet-name>[SERVLET NAME]</servlet-name>
    <servlet-class>[SERVLET CLASS]</servlet-class>
  </servlet>

  <servlet-mapping>
    <servlet-name>[SERVLET NAME]</servlet-name>
    <url-pattern>[SERVLET URL]</url-pattern>
  </servlet-mapping>
</web-app>    
```
